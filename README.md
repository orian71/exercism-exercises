[Public] My own solutions to Exercism.io exercises.

As of June 29, 2020: I am working on Python exercises.

Exercism.io is a web application that hosts hundreds of programming exercises.

I used SoloLearn to learn Python and will apply what I've learned to Exercism's exercises to get better at Python.
